Dini Alice - Assignment no. 2
Three files are provided:
-Ex2.py
-Ex2_Bruteforce.py
-test.py
They have to be stored in the same directory, and, if available, run with Python 3.7.x.

-The file Ex2.py provides the greedy algorithm to solve the SCS problem: it takes as input a set of strings,
and it returns the shortest common superstring as result. It can be tested by uncommenting out the last part.

-The file Ex2_Bruteforce.py, as the name suggests, provides the implementation of the brute force solution
to the same problem. It takes as well a set of strings as input, returning the shortest common superstring as
result. It can be tested by uncommenting out the last part.

-The file test.py provides a sort of unified module that allows to test both the implementations:
it allows the analysis of a FASTA file whose name has to be "sequences.fasta", an hypothetical document
which is not the usual FASTA file, because in this case it should contain different genomic sequences, 
instead of reads. More information are available on the Python's module.
Nevertheless, in both Ex2 and Ex2_Bruteforce modules, a part of code, which is currently put as comment,
can be run to test the module individually, by generating random sequences using the codes provided to
us during the lectures.
